# üê∫ Scraping the Hacker News website (https://news.ycombinator.com/) using JavaScript, NodeJS and Microsoft's [Playwright] (https://playwright.dev/) framework.

I want to grab meaningful data from the above website, in this case it is the first 10 titles and and url links of the ongoing Hacker News feed. 
I then export those findings onto a csv file.

### To get it working: 

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Run script with the `node index.js` command.

PS Update Playwright or install other packages as you see fit/as needed. 
I personally installed fast-csv in the terminal (in terminal: "npm install fast-csv")

PPS I also installed 'SelectorsHub' on Google Chrome to help with xpath and cssSelectors - but it isn't needed if you are just browsing my project.
